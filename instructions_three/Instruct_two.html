            The computer randomly drew a number between 4000 Lira and 6000 Lira to determine the actual project cost. Each whole number on that range was equally likely to be drawn.

            You and the other team member will observe the actual project cost.

            The team’s manager requests the funds for financing the project by submitting a cost report to your firm’s owner.
        </li>
        <li>
            The owner does not know the actual costs, but only that they are between 4000 and 6000 Lira.
        </li>
        <li>
            After receiving the cost report, the owner must provide the funds requested by the cost report. They cannot reject it.
