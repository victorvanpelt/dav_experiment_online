        <li>
            You will randomly and anonymously form a team together with another participant.
        </li>
        <li>
            Both of you will earn a fixed salary of 500 Lira, and your task is to manage a project for your firm.
        </li>
        <li>
            One of you will fulfill the role of the team’s manager and the other one the role of the assistant.
        </li>
        <li>
            The computer will randomly draw your team’s project cost from the following set of Lira:: {4000,4001,…,5999,6000}, where each whole number is equally likely to be drawn.
        </li>
        <li>
            The team’s manager requests the funds for financing the project by submitting his or her cost report to corporate headquarters.
        </li>
        <li>
            Corporate headquarters only knows that the actual project costs never exceed 6000 Lira and are never lower than 4000 Lira.
        </li>
        <li>
            Thus, to receive funds from corporate headquarters and execute the project, the team’s cost report must not exceed 6000 Lira, nor can it be lower than the actual project costs.
        </li>
    </ul>
