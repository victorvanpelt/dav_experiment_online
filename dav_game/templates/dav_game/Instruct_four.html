            Your team keeps the difference between the funds provided by corporate headquarters (based on the team’s cost report) and the actual project cost.

        <li>
            Next, this difference will be split equally between you and the other participant.

            In addition to your share of this difference, you and the other participant will also receive the base salary of 500 Lira.
