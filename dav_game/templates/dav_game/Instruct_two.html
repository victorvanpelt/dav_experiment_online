            The computer will randomly draw your team’s project cost from the following set of Lira: {4000,4001,…,5999,6000}, where each whole number is equally likely to be drawn.
        </li>
        <li>
            The team’s manager requests the funds for financing the project by submitting his or her cost report to your firm's corporate headquarters.
        </li>
        <li>
            Corporate headquarters only knows that the actual project costs are never lower than 4000 Lira and never exceed 6000 Lira.
        </li>
        <li>
            Thus, to receive funds from corporate headquarters for the project, the team’s cost report must not be lower than the actual project costs nor can it exceed 6000 Lira.
        </li>
    </ul>
