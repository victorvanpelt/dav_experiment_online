            The computer randomly drew a number between 4000 Lira and 6000 Lira to determine the actual project cost. Each whole number on that range was equally likely to be drawn.
        </li>
        <li>
            The other two participants observed the actual project cost, and the randomly selected manager requested the funds for financing the project by submitting a cost report.
        </li>
        <li>
            As the owner, you cannot observe the actual costs, nor can you reject the team’s cost report. Instead, after observing the cost report, you provided the funds requested by the cost report.
