        This HIT is an academic study that takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.
    </li>
    <li>
        You will earn $1,35 for completing the HIT. Also, you can earn up to an additional $2.70 depending on your decisions, another participant's decisions, and a random process.
    </li>
    <li>
        The instructions at the start have four simple questions. If you or the other participant answers one of them incorrectly or takes exceptionally long to finish a page, both of you cannot participate any further.
    </li>
    <li>
        In that case, the person who answered one of the four questions incorrectly or took exceptionally long to finish a page will receive no earnings, while the other person will receive $0.50.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you and the other participant answer one of the four control questions correctly and complete the study, the last page will display a completion code. Please copy/paste that code in the box below so we can approve the HIT and transfer your earnings.
